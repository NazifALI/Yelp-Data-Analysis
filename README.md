Dependencies - To run these notebooks, make sure you have installed following python libraries: Plotly, Networkx, Sklearn, Matplotlib and Pandas.

## NOTES:
- Since we used plotly to generate multiple graphs, they cannot be seen in github. This affects 2 of our the notebooks: 489porjects.ipynb and Dataset_exploring.ipynb. If you wish to create plotly figures use your own account information.  
- Make sure to use the correct file path when running notebooks.
